# MPXK

Welcome to MPXK, a fork of MPXJ!

This library provides a set of facilities to allow project information to be manipulated in Java, .Net, Ruby and other languages.

Full documentation including release notes can be found online at [http://mpxj.org](http://mpxj.org). 

# Goals of Fork/Experimental Branch

1. Convert Java code to Kotlin.
2. Remove .Net and Ruby references.
3. Attempt to support Kotlin/Native compilation.
4. If we want .Net and Ruby and Java support, do so via native bindings. Interestingly, since Kotlin/Native provides a C-compatible interface. We should be able to support many other languages.

... and, go. Be patient. MPXK is only an idea for right now. I'll come back here for updates when it works.
